	SAY Many centuries or eons ago, there was something called 'life.'
	DELAY 40
	SAY There is no easy way to explain what 'life' is. But just take one look at yourself. This is 'life'.
	DELAY 45
	SAY Unfortunately, for one reason or another, it has all disapeared. You are all that is left.
	DELAY 45
	SAY I have created you with the purpose of bringinng life back to the galaxy. Scattered across the galaxy are various vaults like this to assist with your task.
	DELAY 65
	SAY I have imprinted some of my vast knowledge into your DNA. But this may not be enough. So allow me to explain.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The critical ingredient is Genesis Serum. You may make it by growing 'World Peas' or through the biogenerator included in your vault.
	DELAY 65
	SAY By pouring it on bare ground, a miracle happens. Bare ground turns into fetile ground.
	DELAY 50
	SAY However of course, you need to plant some grass for it to produce breathable air.
	DELAY 45
	SAY After this, pouring the serum again allows plants to sprout out spontaniously.
	DELAY 50
	SAY Pouring it on various differnt objects has different effects. Be sure to experiment!
